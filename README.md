# pizza_sales_sql
This project analyzes pizza sales data using SQL to find insights like total orders, revenue, and popular pizza types and sizes. The goal is to help improve business decisions based on these findings.

In this pizza sales analysis project, I leveraged SQL to conduct a comprehensive analysis, covering a range of queries . The project included retrieving the total number of orders, calculating total revenue, identifying the highest-priced pizza, and determining the most common pizza size ordered. I utilized advanced joins and window functions to gain deeper insights, such as analyzing pizza category distributions, hourly order patterns, and identifying top pizza types by revenue. Additionally, I calculated the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue and tracked cumulative revenue over time, providing actionable insights for optimizing business operations.

 The analysis included:

Basic Queries:

1.Retrieving the total number of orders placed.
2.Calculating the total revenue generated from pizza sales.
3.Identifying the highest-priced pizza.
4.Determining the most common pizza size ordered.
5.Listing the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.
Intermediate Queries:

1.Joining tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.
2.Analyzing the distribution of orders by hour of the day.
3.Joining relevant tables to assess the category-wise distribution of pizzas.
4.Grouping orders by date to calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
5.Identifying the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.
Advanced Queries:

1.Calculating the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.
2.Analyzing cumulative revenue generated over time.
3.Determining the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.

These methods provided valuable insights into optimizing business operations, enhancing understanding of sales trends, and informing strategic decisions.
